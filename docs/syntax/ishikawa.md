# Ishikawa diagram

Ishikawa diagrams are used to represent causes of a specific event (or a problem).
They are also known as fishbone diagrams, herringbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams.
The diagram resembles a fish skeleton, with the main problem at the head and the causes branching off from the spine.
